This repository shows the projects that I completed to obtain a better understanding of Network Security principles. 
These projects include hands on experiments, labs and reports that correlate with the projects. Every assignment in 
this repository was executed and tested using a virtual machine to ensure self-contained security and to prevent 
from overwriting system files. The virtual machine allows for the simulation of preventetive security measures, 
attacks and experimentation.
