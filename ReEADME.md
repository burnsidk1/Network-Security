This repository shows the projects that I completed to obtain a better understanding of Network 
Security principles. These projects include hands on experiments, labs and reports that correlate 
with the projects. Every assignment in this repository was executed and tested using a virtual
machine to ensure self-contained security and to prevent from overwriting system files. The
virtual machine allows for the simulation of preventetive security measures, attacks and 
experimentation.
